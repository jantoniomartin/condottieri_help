Condottieri, a web based version of the classic game 'Machiavelli'
==================================================================

**Condottieri** is a web based version of the Avalon Hill's game **Machiavelli**.
It's being developed on Django, Pinax and Python, and since October 18th 2010 it
is free and open source software (see COPYING for details on the license).

This project was started by a fan of Machiavelli, only for fun and learning.
It's non-profit oriented and in no way affiliated with Avalon Hill. No media,
images or texts from the original game have been used. However, if you think
that any of the files in this project repository could infringe your copyright,
just contact the author and the content will be removed inmediately.

About 'condottieri_help' application
------------------------------------

This is a Django app made to be plugged to a Django project. Before,
it was part of a common repository (http://github.com/jantoniomartin/condottieri) that integrated the entire Condottieri project. Now, all the applications in
this project have been separated in different repositories, so that they can be
used separetely.

'condottieri_help' is a simple application to show the help pages of the
Condottieri project.

Other applications that were a part of Condottieri and that now have their
own repositories include:

- condottieri_common
- condottieri_events
- condottieri_messages
- condottieri_profiles
- machiavelli

Playing the game
----------------

You are welcome to play the game at the site http://condottierigame.net.

Contributing
------------

Feel free to improve the code of the game. Either you can modify the code (as
stated in the license) or you can suggest improvements by whatever means.

You can also get the official documentation of the game from http://doc.condottierigame.net.

Game rules
----------

Because of copyright, the rules of Machiavelli are not, and will not,
distributed in this repository. If you need the rules, you can try buying the
game (it's not easy, as far as I know) or google them.

The game is based on the official rules of the game, but in no way restricted
to them, so you can make or propose any changes or optional rules that you
think appropriate.
